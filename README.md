# Movie Genre Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict movie genres based on plot summaries using machine learning techniques. It provides a Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation and visualization.

## Files

- `movie_genre_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
- `train_data.csv`: CSV file containing the training data with movie plot summaries and genres.
- `test_data.csv`: CSV file containing the test data with movie plot summaries for prediction.

## Dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb

The dataset used for this project consists of movie plot summaries labeled with genres. The training data (`train_data.csv`) is used to train the model, while the test data (`test_data.csv`) is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
